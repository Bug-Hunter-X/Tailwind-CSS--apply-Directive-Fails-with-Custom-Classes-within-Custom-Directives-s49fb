This error occurs when using Tailwind's `@apply` directive within a custom directive. The issue is that `@apply` only works with pre-defined Tailwind classes, not with custom ones or CSS variables.  Attempting to use `@apply` with a custom class leads to the class not being applied correctly or silently failing, depending on the Tailwind configuration.

```html
<div class="my-custom-directive">
  <!-- This won't apply the custom classes -->
</div>

@layer utilities {
  .my-custom-directive {
    @apply bg-red-500 p-4;
  }
}
```
